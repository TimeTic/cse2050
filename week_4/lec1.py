# ABstract Date Types(ADTS)

# And abstract date type is a model for a collection of data
# defined by its behavior (semantics) from user's perspective

#A data structure is an implementation of an ADT
    # Data structreus are the concrete representations of the underlying data
        # perspective of the implementer
# and ADT should be completlery

"The Stack ADT"
# Our first ADT

# A collection of items with the following behavior(i.e public interface.methods)

#push (item) : add items to the stack
# pop(): removes and returns the next item in a last in FIrst Out(LIFO) ordering
#peek(): returns the enxt item in a LIFO oerdering
#size(): returns the number of iem in the stack
    # pythin well implement the __len__magic method
# isEmpty(): retruns True if the stack has no items and returns false otherwise
